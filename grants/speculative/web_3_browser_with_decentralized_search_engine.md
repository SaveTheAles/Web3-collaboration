# Web3 browser with decentralized search engine

## Project Description
The working concept of a decentralized search engine with a web3 browser. At this time search engine has implemented on Cosmos SDK. Web3 browser based on electron shell. Briefly, chain store knowledge graph with bonds between ipfs CID keys and ipfs CID values. The user can search and improve relevant answers by clicking the current answer. Content creators can link their content with some key. A then a stronger bond between keys and value, the higher answer in search results.

The problems of creating a decentralized search engine are related to the problems that the [decentralized Internet should solve](https://steemit.com/web3/@hipster/an-idea-of-decentralized-search-for-web3-ce860d61defe5est). Transparency, access, motivation, centralized control, unilateral trust, censorship, security.

According to our [roadmap](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/docs/cyberd.md#cyber-protocol-at-euler), we intend to examine another way for implementing our blockchain on other platforms as Substrate. In addition, we want to integrate other blockchain systems in our web3 browser as Polkadot.

As residents of Eastern Europe and Russia, we are faced with an acute problem of [content censoring](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/12/great-firewall-fears-as-russia-plans-to-cut-itself-off-from-internet), as well as the privacy of personal data. According to the team members, decentralized Internet and search for today is the only way to preserve individual freedom in the Internet space.

## Team's experience
As a team we exist for 1,5 years. Till this time we've implement working concept of first decentralized search engine on a blockchain. Secondly, we've implement concept of web3 browser according to our [vision](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/blob/master/docs/web3-vision.md) and finally we've launch in mainnet ethereum database. We call it Chaingear.

Earlier part of our team (@xhipster and @litvintech) launched Golos - russian analog of Steem which is [working](https://golos.io) and [imporoving](https://github.com/GolosChain)

@xhipster also is co-creator of [cyber.fund](http://cyber.fund) and satoshi.fund

## Development Roadmap

For now, already implemented our first public testnet Euler with associated releases of Cyb and Chaingear.

* Q2 2019. Testnet Smith. Integration of new blockchain systems in a web3 browser and debugging interaction algorithms. As a result, cyb will become to the multichain browser (3 or more chains integrated) and 
will be developed an established pattern of new chains integration.

* Q3 2019. Testnet Darwin. Alternative platform for our blockchain implementation. As result: the improved working concept of the cyberd blockchain.

For Smith testnet, we need 500 ETH, for Darwin - 700 ETH.

We've start to attempt to a self-sustained virtuous process but this is not easy at this time. So we intend to a self-sustained virtuous process after 6 months.

## Additional Information

Still, development was funded by team members. Unfortunately we've exhausted all funds but still, trust in our project.

Let's build web3 together.
